===========

Repositories are neat

I think github is really cool and I'm happy to start trying it out.

I love java and javascript, but other stuff is cool too. I really like coldfusion for webpages and how easy jQuery makes complex javascript functions to use. I'm learning Ruby, PHP and Perl right now. I'm excited! I don't know what the hell to expect, I just know it's a lot of info, but it's all really super cool!
